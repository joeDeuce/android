Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the Redemption trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/joeDeuce/android.git -b ics

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

To build:

    vendor/lord/build.sh

Edit vendor/lord/build.sh to suit your needs... I have to make -j2 due
to hardware limitations. :)
